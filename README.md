# Billing Data Management and Forecasting

This project demonstrates my SQL skills with a focus on billing management. It includes SQL queries to manage customer data, generate bills, process payments, and even perform simple forecasting on billing data. 

## Files:
- `create_tables.sql`: Creates necessary tables for customers, bills, and payments.
- `sample_data.sql`: Inserts sample customer, meter, bill, and payment data.
- `queries.sql`: SQL queries for extracting billing and payment information.
- `billing_forecasting.sql`: SQL queries for simple forecasting of future bills.

## Instructions:
1. Run `create_tables.sql` to create the database schema.
2. Run `sample_data.sql` to insert sample data.
3. Use `queries.sql` to extract and analyze billing data.
4. Check the forecasting model in `billing_forecasting.sql`.


### Explanation of Directories:

- **`/sql`**: Contains all the SQL files used in the project:
  - `create_tables.sql`: SQL script to create the necessary tables for customers, meters, bills, and payments.
  - `sample_data.sql`: Inserts sample data into the created tables.
  - `queries.sql`: SQL queries to retrieve and analyze billing data.
  - `billing_forecasting.sql`: SQL code to forecast future billing amounts based on historical data.

- **`/reports`**: Contains markdown files for the generated reports:
  - `billing_report.md`: Summarizes billing activity, including customer bills and payment statuses.
  - `payment_summary.md`: Provides an overview of payment activity, including total payments and outstanding balances.


## Conclusion:

This project simulates tasks commonly performed in a billing department, including generating billing reports, tracking payments, and performing forecasting. It showcases my proficiency in SQL and my ability to manage complex billing data.
