# Billing Data Management and Forecasting

This project demonstrates my SQL skills with a focus on billing management. It includes SQL queries to manage customer data, generate bills, process payments, and even perform simple forecasting on billing data. It is designed to mirror the types of tasks handled in a billing department at Hawaiian Electric (HECO).

## Files:
- `create_tables.sql`: Creates necessary tables for customers, bills, and payments.
- `sample_data.sql`: Inserts sample customer, meter, bill, and payment data.
- `queries.sql`: SQL queries for extracting billing and payment information.
- `billing_forecasting.sql`: SQL queries for simple forecasting of future bills.

## Instructions:
1. Run `create_tables.sql` to create the database schema.
2. Run `sample_data.sql` to insert sample data.
3. Use `queries.sql` to extract and analyze billing data.
4. Check the forecasting model in `billing_forecasting.sql`.
